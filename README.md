# tutorial_rnaseqpipeline
This pipeline has been created to manage RNAseq files within the Noursadeghi's lab. 
This is a tutorial to download your data from our RSD server and start your own RNAseq analysis! 
It's divided in two main steps:
- download the data from the RSD storage - this is OS dependent. 
- create an annoated matrix you can then use with your favourite program for analysis

##For Mac/Linux users 
This is simple, just open the terminal and copy and paste the commands in RNAseqPipeline_yourownmatrix.Rmd
##For Windows
